## 🧠 Concept

The idea behind this portfolio is to make the user feel like they are navigating through a personal computer. You can:

- 🗂️ Open folders to explore projects and content
- 🖱️ Drag and move windows anywhere on the screen
- ❌ Close windows like on a real desktop
- 🎨 Change the desktop background color
- 🎛️ Apply visual screen filters (e.g. grayscale, negative, etc.)
- 🧹 Reset the layout or customize your workspace freely

This concept blends creativity with functionality, providing a unique and playful way to explore my work and personality.
